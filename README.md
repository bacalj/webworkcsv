# webworkcsv

- Allows a Moodle instructor to download a CSV with final grades in a format WebWork can take as an upload.  
- Current version works when Moodle Course ID Number is set to `{{crn}}.{{termcode}}` or `{{crn}}-{{termcode}}`
- If you store student ids in a custom field and need that value to be the one passed to CSV you can name this field in the config
